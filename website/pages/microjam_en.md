# Microjam

A microjam is an event where <u>anyone</u> can create a game in just 5 hours. A [gamejam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam), but smaller!

The jam is first come first served, where the first 40 gets to participate. This is due to recommendations from folkh√§lsomyndigheten. All participants gets free pizza.

We will offer a code skeleton written in Python using the library pygame. The code skeleton will be available **here** before the jam.

The jam will be held Saturday October 3rd 2020 from 3pm to 8pm. Place to be decided.
