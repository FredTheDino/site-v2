# Who are we?

LiTHe kod is a student association at Linköping University whose mission
is to promote and inspire the interest for programming,
software engineering and everything related.

We were founded in the fall of 2013 to organize code meetups where students could
meet, talk and help each other with everything code related.
We have since continued to develop and now we arrange several types of activities
such as study visits, workshops, lectures, GameJams, programming competitions and
of course code meetups.

# Are you a student?

Great! It is you that we are working for.
Because no matter your knowledge there is always an activity just for you and
your programming interests.

Maybe you want to learn more about version control in Git,
maybe you want to hear about how it is to work at Spotify,
or maybe you just want to meet new people who share your interests!

# Becoming a member

You can become a member by contacting us. The easies way to do that
is to go to one of our meetups that we have every Tuesday at 17.00 in Café Java.

The fee of 20kr gives you membership for life, not to mention all
the memories you will make!

# Are you an employer?

LiTHe kod is a gathering point where many of the sharpest and most engaged data/IT
students at Linköping University are included.

By working together with us to arrange activities you get a perfect opportunity to
meet these students and create an interest for you as a future employer.
