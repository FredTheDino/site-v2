# Advent of Code

LiTHe kod will be hosting the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
competition from the 1st of December until its end the 25th. Advent of Code is a
competition in which programming problems are solved each day until Christmas day.

If all problems of the day are solved, two silver stars (one gold star)
are awarded. LiTHe kod will donate one tree for every two silver stars to
[teamtrees.org](https://www.teamtrees.org) for charity. One tree is equivalent
to about 10kr and LiTHe kod will donate up to 15,000kr depending how many
problems have been solved at the end of the competition.

The 10 best competitors will win gift cards with matching sums:

1.  1500kr
2.  1000kr
3.  750kr
4.  500kr
5.  500kr
6.  500kr
7.  200kr
8.  200kr
9.  200kr
10. 200kr

Winners are chosen mainly from the amount of problems solved and secondly
after the points awarded by Advent of Code.

Competing is free and there will be a startup event the 3rd of December in
Caf√© Java at 5pm. Instructions on how to join the competition will be provided
at a later time.
