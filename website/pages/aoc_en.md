LiTHe kod will be hosting the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
competition from the 1st of December until its end on the 25th. Advent of Code
is a competition in which programming problems are solved each day until
Christmas Day.

If all problems of the day are solved, two silver stars (one gold star)
are awarded. LiTHe kod will donate one tree for every two silver stars to
[teamtrees.org](https://www.teamtrees.org) for charity. One tree is equivalent
to about 10 SEK and LiTHe kod will donate up to 15,000 SEK depending on how
many problems have been solved at the end of the competition.

The 10 best competitors will win gift cards with matching sums:

1.  1500 SEK
2.  1000 SEK
3.  750 SEK
4.  500 SEK
5.  500 SEK
6.  500 SEK
7.  200 SEK
8.  200 SEK
9.  200 SEK
10. 200 SEK

Winners are chosen primarily based on the amount of problems solved and
secondly on the points awarded by Advent of Code.

The competing is free and there will be a startup event on the 3rd of December
in Caf√© Java at 5:15 pm. Instructions on how to join the competition will be
provided at a later time.
