A game jam is an event where programmers, artists and gamers come together to create games; both computer games and board games.<br>
At our game jam there is a 48 hours time limit and a randomized theme for inspiration. <br>

We will order food together during both Friday and Saturday evening. If you wish to be included, get your order in along with payment before 7 PM on both nights. Price ranges from 80~100 kr a dish, and you can pay by swish or card. <br>
There is free breakfast on Saturday and Sunday. Fruits, snacks, and hot drinks are available for free during the event. If you bring your own food, there are fridges and microwaves available.

- <em class="highlight">How are groups selected? Do I need a team?</em> <br>
Groups will be randomized for brainstorming purposes, but you are free to work with whomever you like. The starting groups will allow you to find people sharing similar ideas. We make sure everyone finds someone to work with.

It depends on how you like to work. Bringing your own computer is up to you, although we recommend it. CreActive offers free wi-fi, ethernet cables and outlets.
